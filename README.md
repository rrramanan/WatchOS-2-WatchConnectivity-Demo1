# WatchOS-2-WatchConnectivity-Demo1
Using Watch Connectivity Framework sending multiple message to same view controller's "didReceiveMessage" for more activity


Sample demo using AddressBook Framework. Show your iPhone contacts in watch app with the help of iOS parent app. 
Select a contact in watch app to request a phone call in iOS parent app. (Call function is not included just alert view).

Important: Run parent iOS app first, then allow permission to app read your contatcs. Once permission granted, watch app will receive contatcs via "replyhandelr" and list it through table. 

With different Dictionary keys send more message ("sendMessage") from watch app to iOS app (same) view controller's "didReceiveMessage" to  perform various operations.
